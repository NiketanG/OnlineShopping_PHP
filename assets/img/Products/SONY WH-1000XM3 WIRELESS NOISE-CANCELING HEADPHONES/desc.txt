NEXT-LEVEL NOISE CANCELLATION
An update to the acclaimed WH-10000XM2, the Sony WH1000XM3 headphones offer crisp, high-resolution audio in a sleek wireless design. Whether you’re in a crowd, on the train, or in any other noisy environment, Sony’s digital noise-canceling technology actively cuts out unwanted sound. The Adaptive Sound Control feature works with the QN1 noise-canceling processor to detect activities like traveling, walking, and waiting, and adjusts the ambient sound settings accordingly. Unique Atmospheric Pressure Optimizing technology delivers optimal sound at high altitudes. In addition to Bluetooth, the headphones have an LDAC that transmits approximately three times more data than Bluetooth for exceptional clarity. Thanks to the built-in mic and onboard controls, you can take calls and control your music without taking your phone out of your pocket.
